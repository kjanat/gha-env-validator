# gha-env-validator - StackBlitz Playground

Welcome to the interactive playground for `@kjanat/gha-env-validator`!

## Quick Start

After dependencies install, build the package first:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then explore the source code and examples in the `examples/` directory.

> **Note**: StackBlitz doesn't support Bun or GitHub Actions environment variables, so this is mainly for code exploration. For full functionality, use locally or in a GitHub Actions workflow.

## Available Examples

- `basic-usage.ts` - Simple environment validation
- `custom-variables.ts` - Extending with custom vars
- `safe-validation.ts` - Non-throwing validation
- `workflow-integration.ts` - Complete workflow example
- `workflow-commands-demo.ts` - All workflow commands
- `complete-action-example.ts` - Full action implementation
- `metadata-*.ts` - Metadata use cases (5 examples)
